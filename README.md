# Intro-to-Robert-Jones
Hello I am Robert Jones! I am 20 Years old (well almost) and I am in my second semester in College! I am currently looking for a career in animation and graphic design! I like working on animation and using computers, but I like to
disconnect from technology and go swimming (seasonal) and walk on the treadmill! I am also very artistic and I love drawing and making music compositions on my
Yamaha brand piano! I am a Disney nerd, especially Disney Afternoon (DuckTales, Gummi Bears, Aladdin, Talespin, etc.) and a fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
I have been to 13 Disney On Ice shows over a span of 15 years! I am also a huge fan of Jim Henson's Muppets!
