# Intro-to-Robert-Jones
Hello I am Robert Jones! I am 20 Years old (well almost) and I am in my second semester in College! I am currently looking for a career in animation and graphic design!

I **love** working on animation and using computers, but I like to
disconnect from technology and go swimming (seasonal) and walk on the treadmill! I am also very artistic and I love drawing and making music compositions on my
Yamaha Piano for various animated projects![68736972_2424466077833573_3447662250993647616_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98345898/151428450-37368617-cef0-4988-a5eb-5fb748e1348f.jpg)
I have two parents, a sister, and two dogs

I am a fan of Disney, NOT the corporate side (Star Wars and Marvel in general) but a lot of their animated films!

I have been to 13 Disney On Ice shows over a span of 15 years! This is one of them (I wish lol)

I am also a fan of Jim Henson's Muppets and their many misadventures! Here's photographic proof that Snuffleupaguses are real and NOT imaginary:

As much as I am into current brands, I am also into a lot of '80s stuff like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Real Ghostbusters, Peanuts, etc.

I am looking forward to coding and for a wonderful year here at Millersville! Go Marauders!
